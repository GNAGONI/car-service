</p></li>
              <li><p>Advertising a vehicle for purchase as a used car or for scrappage by one of the Purchasing Companies, as set out in clause 5. </p></li>
              <li><p>We also provide a 7 day listing facility (“Auction”), as set out in clause 6.</p></li>

          </li>
          <li><p><strong>Proof of identity</strong>. You will be required to provide proof of identity and address (for example, photo ID and a utility bill) to the Purchasing Company when selling a vehicle via the car.service platform.

</p></li>
          <li><p>By accepting a quote or by listing a vehicle on the car.service platform, you warrant that you are the owner of the vehicle or that you have the owner’s authorisation to sell the vehicle on their behalf. </p></li>

We do not guarantee that the vehicle will be sold or that you will achieve the best price available for the vehicle by using car.service.

          <li><p><strong>Access to the vehicle</strong>. You must allow the Purchasing Company access to the vehicle for inspection and collection. If you do not make the vehicle available for inspection or collection by the Purchasing Company, despite the Purchasing Company’s reasonable efforts to access the vehicle, the Purchasing Company may treat the contract to purchase the vehicle as at an end, even where the vehicle is as described in the listing. We exclude all liability to you for any loss of damage suffered as a result of your failure to grant the Purchasing Company access to the vehicle for inspection and collection.
</p></li></ol>
        </li>
        <li class="header"><h3>Instant quote</h3>
          <p><em>Unless expressly provided in this agreement, this clause applies solely in relation to the instant quote function described in clause 3.1.1</em></p>
          <ol>
            <li><p>The quote produced by the car.service platform and referred to at 3.1.1 is generated automatically based on your location and the price the Purchasing Companies have indicated they are prepared to pay for the vehicle. This price will take into account the cost of collecting the vehicle and any commission payable to us by the Purchasing Company, but is not guaranteed (see clause 1.1).
            </p></li>
            <li><p>If you accept the quote provided under clause 3.1.1, the Purchasing Company will agree a date and time with you to inspect the vehicle. You agree to make the vehicle available for inspection and collection at the date and time agreed with the Purchasing Company. </p></li>
            <li><p>If the vehicle is as described by you and is suitable and available for collection, the Purchasing Company will collect the car, and payment will be transferred from the Purchasing Companies account to you as soon as reasonably practical.</p></li>
            <li><p>If the vehicle is not as described (for example the vehicle does not have alloy wheels or a battery) or the vehicle is not suitable or available for collection at the date and time you agreed with the Purchasing Company, the Purchasing Company may reject the vehicle. If the Purchasing Company rejects your vehicle, they must notify us of the rejection and provide evidence that the vehicle was not as described or was not suitable or available for collection. </p></li>
            <li><p>If the Purchasing Company rejects the vehicle, we will have no liability or further obligations to you under this agreement. For the avoidance of doubt, rejection of the adjusted price by you or of the vehicle by the Purchasing Company does not stop you from:</p>
              <ol>
                  <li><p>seeking an updated quote under car.service under clause 3.1.1;</p></li>
                  <li><p>listing the vehicle for purchase as a used car or for scrappage by one of the Purchasing Companies under clause 3.1.2; or</p></li>

        <li class="header"><h3>Two hour listing</h3>
          <p><em>Unless expressly provided in this agreement, this clause shall apply solely in relation to the sale of a vehicle further to a two hour listing as described in clause 3.1.2.</em></p>
          <ol>
            <li><p>If you list a vehicle for sale under clause 3.1.2, the vehicle will be advertised on the car.service platform for a period of two hours during which Purchasing Companies may submit offers to you to purchase the vehicle. If you choose to accept a Purchasing Company’s offer, clauses 4.2 to 4.5 will apply in the same way as if you had accepted our instant quote. If you do not accept an offer made to you during the listing period but you wish to continue using car.service to sell the vehicle, the options available to you are as listed at clause 4.5 above.
            </p></li>
            <li><p>You may accept an offer on the vehicle before the two-hour listing period described in clause 5.1 has lapsed. If you choose to do so, we reserve the right to continue to list the vehicle privately to the Purchasing Companies. The vehicle would no longer appear on our public car.service platform but will remain visible to the Purchasing Companies who may make a higher offer to us than the quote you have accepted. If they make a higher offer to us than the quote you have accepted, we will not be liable to you for the difference in price and you will only be paid the quote). </p></li>

          <p><em>Unless expressly provided in this agreement, this clause applies solely in relation to 7-day Auction listings placed by you on the car.service platform. </em></p>
          <ol>
            <li><p>The car.service platform is a sales platform fulfilling an intermediary role. We are a market place, not a traditional auctioneer.</p></li>
            <li><p><strong>Duration</strong>. The Auction listing will last for 7 days. We will agree the start time and date during the application process. The listing will always start and end on a business day (for example, if you apply to place a listing on a Saturday, the earliest it will appear on our platform will be the following Monday). During the Auction, Purchasing Companies may submit offers to you for the vehicle. Each Purchasing Company will be able to see the highest offer placed by any other Purchasing Company. </p></li>
            <li><p><strong>Reserve Price </strong>. You may set a reserve price for the vehicle. This is the price below which you would not be prepared to sell the vehicle. The Purchasing Companies will not know what the reserve price is. If the reserve price is not met, you are not obliged to sell the vehicle.
</p></li>
            <li><p><strong>Obligation to sell</strong>. Subject to clause 6.3, you are obliged to accept the highest bid placed by a Purchasing Company during the Auction. You will be notified of the bids placed during the Auction (within the client portal/by email). At the end of the Auction, we will confirm the identity of the highest bidder, to whom you are obliged to sell the vehicle.
</p></li>
            <li><p><strong>Payment, inspection and collection.</strong> Payment for and inspection and collection of the vehicle shall follow the same procedure as set out in clauses 4.2 to 4.5.

          <ol>
            <li><p><strong>Obtaining an instant quote</strong>. Obtaining a quote from our website does not create a contract between you and us under these terms. You use our website in accordance with our <a href="/terms/website" target="_blank">Acceptable Use Policy. </a>
</p></li>
            <li><p><strong>If you accept our instant quote. </strong>. Our contract with you commences when you accept the offer made to you in an instant quote.

          </li>
          <li><p><strong>More significant changes to the services or to these terms</strong>.

          <li><p><strong>We are not responsible for delays outside our control</strong>. If our supply of our services is delayed by an event outside our control then we will contact you as soon as possible to let you know and we will take steps to minimise the effect of the delay. Provided we do this we will not be liable for delays caused by the event, but if there is a risk of substantial delay you may contact us to end the contract and receive a refund for any products you have paid for but not received. We will list the product as soon as reasonably practicable after the event outside our control comes to an end.</p></li>
          <li><p><strong>What will happen if you do not give required information to us.</strong> We or the Purchasing Company may need certain information from you so that we can list the vehicle, for example, your proof of identity or the make and model of the vehicle which you are listing for sale or scrappage. This will have been requested when you placed your order for the listing via our website. If this information is missing, we will not be able to post your listing. If you do not give us this information when we ask for it, or if you give us incomplete or incorrect information, we may end the contract (and clause 15 will apply) and we will not post the listing. We will not be responsible for supplying our services late or not supplying any part of them if this is caused by you not giving us the information we need within a reasonable time of us asking for it.</p></li>

    <h3>Price and payment</h3>
    <ol>
        <li><p><strong>Instant quote and two-hour listing.</strong> We do not charge you any upfront cost to use our instant quote functionality or to place a two-hour listing a vehicle for scrappage or for sale as a used vehicle. The price of the service will be a fixed rate commission payable by the Purchasing Company to us. </p></li>
        <li><p><strong>Auction.</strong> The price to list a vehicle for Auction is as indicated on the order pages when you submit your application to list an Auction. Payment for the Auction is due on submission of the application to list an Auction and services requiring payment will not be provided until payment is received. You can pay for the services via our payment portal using PayPal or the following cards: Visa, Maestro and MasterCard. Our charges for listing an Auction may change from time to time, but changes will not affect any listings which we have already begun to provide. </p></li>
        <li><p>Payment to you of proceeds of sale. The proceeds of sale from the vehicle for an instant quote will be paid to you by the Purchasing Company. When the vehicle has been collected by the Purchasing Company in accordance with clauses 4.2 or 4.4 (and as referred to in clauses 5.1 and 6.5) of this agreement, the proceeds of sale will be transferred to the account you provided details of at registration.</p></li>
        <li><p><strong>What happens if we got the quote wrong when providing an instant quote.</strong> It is always possible that, despite our reasonable efforts, you may be quoted the wrong price for the purchase or scrapping of a vehicle. We will normally take reasonable steps to ensure that our prices are up to date and check quotes before offering a price to you. If when we provided an instant quote which you accept the correct price per ton is less than the Purchasing Company's stated tonnage price at that time, we will pay you the higher amount. If when we provided an instant quote which you accept the correct price per ton is lower than the tonnage price quoted to you, we will contact you for your instructions before the Purchasing Company collects the vehicle.</p></li>
        <li><p><strong>When a Purchasing Company makes a mistake when giving you a quote.</strong> We do not monitor or control the quotes given to users by Purchasing Companies. If we are notified of an error in the quote, they have given to you, we will let you know using the contact details you provided to us on registration. If you think a price is wrong, you should let us know or contact the Purchasing Company who gave you the quote. For the avoidance of doubt, we accept no liability in respect of a third party's pricing errors.</p></li>
        <li><p><strong>We accept no liability if you accept an instant quote</strong> or an offer pursuant to a listing where a pricing error is obvious and unmistakeable and could reasonably have been recognised by you as a mispricing.</p></li>

    <p>Except where expressly provided in this Contract, this section applies solely in relation to our Instant Quote function and your obligations in respect of quotes given by us to Sellers using our Instant Quote function.</p>
    <ol>
      <li>Under our Instant Quote functionality, we offer Sellers the opportunity to accept an Instant Quote from us for the sale of a Vehicle for scrap. We make those offers on the basis of your and other Purchasing Companies’ Pricing Lists. </li>
      <li>By registering as a Purchasing Company and using our Platform, you appoint us as your non-exclusive agent to provide Instant Quotes for Vehicles on your behalf and to commit you to purchasing a Vehicle where a Seller accepts an Instant Quote provided by us in accordance with and reliance on your Pricing List (please see clause 4.4). Where the Vehicle is as described by the Seller and is capable of collection, you shall be bound to purchase the Seller’s Vehicle (please see clause 4.6). Where the Vehicle is not as described by the Seller or is not suitable for collection, please refer to clauses 4.7 and 4.8.</li>
      <li>The Instant Quote and the inspection and collection of a Vehicle pursuant to clause 4.2 shall be subject to our Terms.</li>
      <li><strong>If an Instant Quote is accepted by a Seller.</strong> Where a Seller accepts an Instant Quote in accordance with clause 4.2, we will notify you of their acceptance and you shall be bound to purchase the Seller’s Vehicle provided the Vehicle is as described in the listing (please see clause 4.6).</li>
      <li>
        <strong>Payment.</strong>
        We will notify you to confirm that an Instant Quote has been accepted and set out our Charges (see clause 12). The payment for the car shall be transferred as follows:
        <ol>
          <li>You shall immediately transfer to the seller via a BACS payment to the bank account details supplied by the seller as part of the quote; </li>
          <li>Upon invoice by Car.service, a payment shall be made within 30 days to the bank account supplied on the invoice.</li>
        </ol>

Subject to obtaining satisfactory proof of identity, you must collect the Vehicle, and arrange for payment of the Purchase Price to be transferred to the Seller.
      </li>
      <li><strong>If the Vehicle is not as described. </strong>If upon inspection of the Vehicle it is apparent that the Vehicle does not match the description given by the Seller and this negatively impacts on the value of the Vehicle (for example the car does not have alloy wheels), you will not be obliged under these Terms to purchase the Vehicle. For the avoidance of doubt, we will not be liable to you for any loss or damage suffered as a result of a Vehicle not being as described by the Seller.</li>
      <li><strong>If the Vehicle is not accessible for collection. </strong> If despite using your reasonable endeavours to collect the Vehicle, the Vehicle is not accessible (for example, because the Vehicle is not safe to move, has been destroyed, you cannot gain access to the Vehicle for collection, or you have not been able to adequately identify the Seller), you will not be obliged under these Terms to collect the Vehicle.. For the avoidance of doubt, we will not be liable to you for any loss or damage suffered as a result of a Vehicle not being accessible for collection. For the avoidance of doubt, we will not be liable to you in any circumstances for any costs incurred by you in attending the Seller or inspecting the Vehicle.</li>
      <li><strong>We do not provide a sale guarantee.</strong>Our “Instant Quote” functionality is programmed to offer Sellers the best price available per-ton of scrap in their postcode and therefore by entering into this Contract you acknowledge that we do not promote one Purchasing Company over another.
