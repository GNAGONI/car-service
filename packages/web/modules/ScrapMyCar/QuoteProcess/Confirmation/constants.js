              The Scrap Metal Dealers Act requires that we confirm your identity when you hand over your scrap
              car, which applies in England and Wales.

            <p>
              A current photo-card driving licence is all that we need to confirm your full name, date of birth
              and residential address.
            </p>
            <p>
              If you don't have a photo-card driving license, you can produce another form of photo ID, along with
              separate proof of your address. You'll need one item from each of the two Government approved lists.
